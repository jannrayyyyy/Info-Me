Not wanting to get hurt, Maple opts to be a shield user with maxed-out defense stats, and continues putting every status point she earns in the game into increasing only her defense level. As a result, she is left with slow foot speed and no magic, but her high defense allows her to endure most hits without taking any damage. This, along with her basic-level creative thinking, allows for her to make unexpected accomplishments in the game, its quests and events. By doing this, she ends up earning all kinds of equally unexpected skills and becomes one of the strongest players in the game.',

                  'Darling in the Franxx takes place in a dystopian post-apocalyptic future where the remnants of human civilization have abandoned the surface. Adults and children exist in contrasting environments from each other. Adults live in technologically advanced cities within Plantations and are immortal, but procreation and relationships among them have become obsolete and undesirable. Artificially-created children, termed "parasites", are deprived of individuality and are educated only for piloting Franxx in pairs to defend humanity. The children are kept in isolation from adult society in environments nicknamed "birdcages", which emulate that of a bygone era so that they can develop the emotional responses required to pilot Franxx. In the early 21st century, the progress of human civilization was accelerated by ground-breaking discoveries in mining technology, allowing the extraction of magma energy for a new low-cost, all-encompassing energy source. Scientists contributing to the breakthrough form "APE", an organization that would significantly influence world politics and the global economy as a result of their discoveries. After discovering human immortality, much of mankind opted to become immortal despite the side effect of losing their reproductive functions. A cult of personality surrounds Papa, the chairman of the APE, which all humans come to worship akin to a god. Now governing the remnants of civilization, APE leads humanity to abandon Earth\'s now desolate surface for the relative safety of mobile fortress-cities known as Plantations.',

Housing varies, but the most affordable is the Polaris Dormitory, where students have to impress the dorm matron with a dish in order to secure residence.

Students can initiate a shokugeki (anime: food war), a cook-off with stipulations on the line, with any other student or alumnus. Battles fought in this way could be for cooking utensils, research society facilities, council membership, or even expulsion from the school.',

Three thousand years after casting his spell, Varvatos is reborn as Ard Meteor a typical villager born to your average parents (as far as he knows anyway). Little does he know that his parents are famous mages and that his magical abilities are still much more powerful than your average person. Ard\'s early years go by with him camped out in his parents’ library. He wants to make friends but struggles to interact with the other kids from the town, so dives into books instead. At the age of 12 things begin to change for our protagonist as he meets an elf girl called Ireena while out practising magic. Fast forward to Ard at age 15 and the two become inseparable friends who, having reached the beginning of adulthood, are being sent to The Academy of Magic by their parents. In his past life, Ard was bullied at school and doesn’t want to attend in this life, but with Ireena going, he feels he has no choice. Once there our hero is quickly branded a weirdo, with magic so powerful even Ard begins to realise he’s not the average villager he had hoped to become. Standing out among the students is fine as long as he has Ireena by his side, but it’s not long before he finds himself in deep trouble, no matter how much he tries to live a normal life.',
